## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Git
- cPanel hosting with FTP access (for deployment)

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

The `.env` file is automatically configured by Lovable Cloud:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

> **Note**: These are automatically managed - do not edit manually.

## 🚀 Deployment to cPanel

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

Add the following secrets:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase anon key |

### Step 2: Deploy

Deployment is automatic on push to `main` branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Action will:
1. ✅ Build the React application
2. ✅ Generate optimized production files
3. ✅ Create `.htaccess` for SPA routing
4. ✅ Create `deploy-package.zip` artifact

### Step 3: Manual Upload to cPanel

1. Download `deploy-package` artifact from GitHub Actions
2. Login to cPanel File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder
4. Upload and extract `deploy-package.zip`
5. Delete the ZIP file after extraction

### cPanel Manual Upload — Detailed Guide

1. Backup current `public_html` (download a ZIP backup or copy files to a `backup/` folder).
2. If you have a custom `.htaccess`, download it first — the workflow creates a default `.htaccess` in `dist` but you may want to preserve custom rules.
3. In cPanel File Manager, click `Upload` and select `deploy-package.zip` (artifact from Actions).
4. After upload completes, select the file and click `Extract`. Choose `public_html/` as the destination.
5. Verify that `index.html` and the asset folders (e.g., `assets/`) are present at the site root.
6. Remove the `deploy-package.zip` file from the server after extracting to save space.
7. Confirm file permissions — static assets should be world-readable (typically `644`) and folders `755`.
8. If you use custom redirects or rewrites, merge them into the `.htaccess` generated by the workflow.

Notes & troubleshooting:
- If you see 404s for client-side routes, ensure `.htaccess` is present and `mod_rewrite` enabled in Apache.
- For large uploads, use cPanel's `Upload` via FTP or the Terminal (if available) to avoid timeouts.

### Credentials & Admin Access (Supabase)

The frontend is static — runtime secrets are baked at build time via GitHub Secrets. To configure admin accounts and backend credentials:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2. Under `Authentication` -> `Users`, create an admin user with email and password (or invite an existing email).
3. Under `Table Editor`, open the `profiles` table and add/update the profile row for that user (name, role, company fields as needed).
4. If you use a `user_roles` table, add an entry granting the `admin` role to the new user. Alternatively, use your app's admin setup UI after signing in.

Security tips:
- Use long, unique passwords for admin accounts and enable MFA if supported.
- Keep GitHub Secrets (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) private and rotate keys if compromised.
- Use RLS (Row Level Security) and policies in Supabase to restrict admin-only operations.

### CI: browserslist DB update

The workflow now runs `npx update-browserslist-db@latest --quiet` before the build to keep `caniuse-lite` current and suppress the build-time warning. No action is needed on your side, but you can run the same command locally to update your environment.

### Optional: Automate deployment via FTP/SFTP

If you prefer automatic uploads to cPanel, you can add an extra step in the workflow to upload `deploy-package.zip` via `appleboy/scp-action` or use FTP actions — this requires storing FTP credentials as GitHub Secrets (e.g., `CPANEL_FTP_HOST`, `CPANEL_FTP_USER`, `CPANEL_FTP_PASSWORD`). For security, prefer short-lived deploy keys and limit permissions.

### Parallel Phased Action Workflow (recommended)

This project follows a phased approach to implement large updates safely and in parallel. Use the plan below to coordinate work, CI, and releases.

- Phase 1 — Audit & Fixes
   - Run linters and build in CI.
   - Audit responsive layouts and accessibility across devices.
   - Fix critical layout and UX issues (Header, Footer, Hero, Contact, PreviewModal).

- Phase 2 — Demo Management & Analytics
   - Implement bulk import, masked links, credentials handling (admin features are implemented in `DemoManagement`).
   - Add fingerprinting and categorize interaction events for richer reporting (implemented in `useAnalytics` and `Analytics`).
   - Add DB migrations to add `fingerprint` and `category` columns to analytics tables.

- Phase 3 — Security & Performance
   - Harden iframe usage, set `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"` and `loading="lazy"` on preview iframes (done).
   - Improve build chunking (see `vite.config.ts` manualChunks) and run `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` in CI (workflow updated).
   - Review CSP and security headers in `.htaccess` (workflow generates a baseline `.htaccess`).

- Phase 4 — Polish, Docs & Deployment
   - Finish responsive polish and accessibility fixes.
   - Update `README.md` with deployment steps and admin setup (this file).
   - Prepare release notes and changelog; create PR for review.

- Phase 5 — Release & Monitor
   - Merge PR, build artifact, and upload to cPanel (manual or automated FTP step).
   - Monitor analytics and error logs; iterate on feedback.

DB migration notes:
- Add `fingerprint` (text) to `visitor_analytics` and `interaction_events` tables.
- Optionally add a `category` column to `interaction_events` for categorized event reports.

CI & PR checklist:
- Run `npm ci` and `npm run build` in CI.
- Run `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` before the build to keep caniuse-lite current (workflow step added).
- Include screenshots and responsive checks in PR description.
- Assign reviewers for accessibility and security.
